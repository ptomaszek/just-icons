Actually the extension removes (not simply hides!) titles from the bookmarks and stores them in Extension's memory for future restoration. It means that if you use Chrome Sync, bookmarks on your other devices will be affected. If your Chrome crashes for some reason, it's possible that you'll be left without a way to restore bookmark titles. You've been warned ;). Feel free to ask questions.\n\nNow enjoy your new aesthetic bookmarks bar",
