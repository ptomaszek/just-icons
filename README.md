Just Icons on the Bookmarks Bar in Chrome
----------------------------------------

Install from Chrome Web Store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/just-icons/cebjhochebphokcpenikgbljlbmlhefm

**Click to hide titles of your bookmarks. Click again to restore them.**

In Options, you can tune scope of hiding, i.e. whether to include subfolders.

**IMPORTANT**: Restore the bookmarks titles before uninstalling the extension. Otherwise, the
titles will be lost. 
Unfortunately, Chrome doesn't allow the extension to detect its uninstallation and to handle restoration automatically. 

Best back up bookmarks before the very first use of the extension - howto https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/96816?hl=en
